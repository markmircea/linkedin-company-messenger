Hello! I wanted to share a script i created yesterday to help me in my job search. You must be on the linkedin companies page. For the most part all companies allow anyone to message them even if you dont follow them. 

This script will automatically go through all of the companies (100 pages of 10) of you search query. 
for example, I am on the page https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/COMPANIES/?keywords=web%20development&origin=SWITCH_SEARCH_VERTICAL&sid=VX%3A

Press F12 to open devtools, then copy paste this script to run it (note that the window must be open to paginate properly) hope this helps someone. Feel free to modify the message as you see fit!

Cheers!
